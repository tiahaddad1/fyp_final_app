# fyp_application

This application is developed in Flutter for an undergraduate final year project. It is an application designed for young learners on the spectrum and their caregivers to manage their daily routines, schedules, and skills.

## Info about the application

The front-end code is fully functional based on the application's functional requirements. Most of the back-end code is developed but there are code to be developed and tested for.

## Getting Started with Flutter

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running the application

To run the application, Flutter must be installed on your idle. For instance, the developer developed and ran the application on VS Code. Flutter is installed on their device and is an extension in the idle.

Furthermore, to build and run the project, please ensure that:

1. You are in the main file (project's directory -> lib -> main) then, navigate to:
   the menu bar > Run > Run without debugging
2. The phone simulator (iOS) is connected to VS Code. The developer worked on an iPhone 13 Pro phone simulator when developing the application. For more information on how to install/link a simulator to your idle, please refer to the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3MIW5wq-RY&ab_channel=HeyFlutter%E2%80%A4com

The project should run accordingly without errors; however, if you experience any errors, please search it up online or you can contact the developer via GitHub or either emails:

- K1910052@kingston.ac.uk
- Haddad_tia@hotmail.com

Thank you :)
